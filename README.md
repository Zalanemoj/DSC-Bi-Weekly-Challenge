🎯 About
This repository contains my solutions to bi-weekly data science challenges. Each challenge focuses on different aspects of data science, including:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Machine learning model development
Data visualization
Statistical analysis
The challenges are designed to improve problem-solving skills, explore new techniques, and build a portfolio of data science projects.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.8 or higher
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Git
Installation


Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Zalanemoj/DSC-Bi-Weekly-Challenge.git
cd DSC-Bi-Weekly-Challenge
Create a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If requirements.txt doesn't exist, create one with common dependencies:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter
scipy


🛠️ Technologies Used
Python - Primary programming language
Jupyter Notebook - Interactive development environment
Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy - Numerical computing
Matplotlib & Seaborn - Data visualization
Scikit-learn - Machine learning library
SciPy - Scientific computing


💻 Usage
Navigate to the Scripts/ directory
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
Open the desired challenge notebook (e.g., DSC_Challenge_1.ipynb)
Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis
Each notebook is self-contained and includes:
Problem description
Data loading and exploration
Analysis and modeling steps
Results and conclusions
